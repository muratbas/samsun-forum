# Product Context: Samsun Forum

## Why This Exists

### The Problem
Samsun residents currently rely on fragmented, chaotic social media groups (Facebook, WhatsApp) to:
- Ask local questions ("Where's the best pideci in Atakum?")
- Share community updates ("Road work on Atatürk Bulvarı")
- Discuss local sports (Samsunspor matches)
- Discover events happening in the city

These platforms lack:
- Organization and searchability
- Quality content through voting
- Persistent, accessible knowledge base
- City-focused moderation

### The Solution
A dedicated, hyper-local forum that serves as Samsun's digital "meydan" (public square) - a central gathering place for:
- **Local Knowledge**: Searchable repository of restaurant recommendations, traffic updates, local tips
- **Community Voice**: Democratic content curation through voting
- **Event Discovery**: Centralized view of what's happening in Samsun
- **Safe Space**: Moderated environment specific to Samsun culture

## How It Works
